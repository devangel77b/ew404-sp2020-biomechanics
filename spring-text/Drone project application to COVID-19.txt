How is S.T.E.V.E. applicable to the current COVID-19 situation? 


With the need for finding effective methods to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic spreading, there are several solutions that drones can offer during the crisis. Because S.T.E.V.E. is a platform that is aimed at carrying an extraction device capable of retrieving and securing plant samples from the origin and back, S.T.E.V.E. could serve public safety agencies in several aspects of the COVID-19 mitigation mission. By modifying the end effector and payload capacity, S.T.E.V.E could retrieve and deliver medical supplies or testing kits to hard to reach places where hospitals or testing sites may not be readily accessible. S.T.E.V.E. could also return to the same destination to pick up the testing samples and return them to hospitals or testing sites for testing so that public safety employees don’t have to risk encountering those who may be affected by COVID-19. Furthermore, with computer vision, S.T.E.V.E. has the potential to monitor public spaces and identify large groups gathering and alert public safety agencies so that gatherings can be separated quickly. With agencies that already specialize in drone operations, S.T.E.V.E. could be quickly implemented for use without any large learning curve associated with it besides the end effector of the extraction device which could be modified for different missions in countering COVID-19.
